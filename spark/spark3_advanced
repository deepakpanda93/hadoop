Loading
RDD can be created from Text files, JSON, parallize on collections, sequence files.

Storing
RDD can be stored to text files, JSON, sequence files, collections, databases, or use SPARK utilities 

Partitioning 
Partitions are enable per RDD by default, based on the parameter spark.default.parallelism, by default number of cores in clusters
Should configure in large clusters to know what is the correct partition size.
Can be specified the number during creation of RDD
Derived RDD take the same number of partitions as the source.

Persistence
Load when need to be used and dropped once is over.
This avoid re compute the entire RDD chain, persist intermediate RDD so dont need to be recompute
Can be persistent intermediate RDD to save it to avoid reprocessing,
  persist()- Memory, disk, shared or third party sink
  cache()- Use the default persist method - In memory

Broadcast variables.
All the variables all local unles you use broadcast variables, and can be used across the entire cluster
Used to lookup tables or similars functions.
Read only variables shared in all nodes, once created can not modifiedl
Spark optimization of distribution and storage to get better performance in the spark clusters

Accumulators.
A shared variables that can be used and updates in all the nodes in any moment at the same time.
Help when the reduce operations not take certain items, for any unsupport things
Spark distribute and takes care of race conditions
