http://spark.apache.org.
Fast and general engine for large-scala data processing, faster than apache hadoop as it is not batch processing.
Cluster computing framework, and it is open source engine.
End-to-end analythics.
Develop to overcome limitation of haddop, map reduce are very disk based and batch processing. More real time
Spark keeps data in memory, can be run along other hadoop components.
Can run in single desktop or huge clusters
Iterative and interactive(analytic shell) or stream processing (data is comming and you do some processing)
Scala, R, Python, Java. --- Spark is develop in Scala.
Options alibraries like Graph, SQL, ML, Streaming

Use Cases.
 - Data integration and ETL
 - Interactive  Analytics.
 - High Performance Batch computation
 - Machine Libraries and Advanced Analytics.
 - Real time stream processing.
