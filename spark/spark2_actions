Actions.
Produce a Result not an RDD.
trigger the actions and execute the previously lazy evaluation functions

collect-return elements of RDD as an array
count
first - first element in the RDD
take(n), returns the first n elements
reduce, performs operations across, each element in the RDD and return a result such as: sum, count
        reduce takes a function that takes to values function(input1, input2), reduce function, recursively in each element in RDD
        a, b, c, d, e
        R,    c
              R, d
                 R, e
                    R  -- recursively function
                    
        Does not work in partitions, in only performs in nodes, execute in serial fashion, not in pararell 
        
aggregate, parallel computation across partitions and then combine them
           execute action and then aggregate
            - sequence, perform in each partition, can be happen in parallel
            - combine, combine result of the sequence operation results, and produce a global result.
