Regression Analysis.
  Method of investigating functional relationshiop between varianles.
  Estimate the value of dependant variables from independet using and equation.
  When are continuos and have some correlation.
  Goodness of Fit analaysis is important.
  
  Linear equation. R-square near to 1, will be ideal
   Coefficients, Intercept and R-squared are the linea equation values
   Fast, low cost in memory and cpu usage, excellent for linear relationship, relatively accurate continuos variables.
   CONS: Can not model non-linear/fuzzy relationship, only numeric/continuos variables
   
  Decision Tree.
   Predictor variables are used to build a tree that would progressively predict the target variable
   Lead nodes provide the decisions
   Branch nodes refine the decision process.
   Trainign data is used to build a decision tree to predict the target.
   Tree become a model. you use the model to predict for new data.
   Different varaibles and idfferent sequences, you could view different trees and levels and outcome.
   Using predictors with high selectivity gives faster results.
   PRO: Easy to interpret and explan, works with missing data, sensitive to local variations, fast
   CON: Limited accuracy, bias builds up prettry quicly, not good with large number of predictors.
   APPS: Credit approvals, situations with legal needs to explain decisions, preliminary categorization
